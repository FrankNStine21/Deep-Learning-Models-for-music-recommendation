HowToFile:

All python files and saved models must be in the same directory,
as well as the FMA dataset. 

The dataset on my loacal machine is structred as:

FMA/mel/mel/(*genres)

For training, the directories for the flow_from_directory functions
can be easily changed at the top of the file.

For predicting, any path can be specified for the img variable
